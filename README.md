# Discord bot

## Picolingus is typo checking bot for Discord.

It leverages the [GPT-4o-mini](https://openai.com) model to provide suggestions for typos in the messages sent by users.

### Usage

To use the bot, simply add emoji `??`(open book) to your message and the bot will respond with suggestions for typos.

It will create a new thread with the suggestions, so as not to clutter the main chat.

In the thread the user is able to interact with the bot/AI to get more suggestions or to ignore some of them.
